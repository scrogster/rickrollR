# rickrollR

R is a feature-rich programming language. Lexical scoping and lazy evaluation are all very  well, but what's the point of a programming language that doesn't help users to [rickroll?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rickrolling)?

The __rickrollR__ package adresseses this deficiency by providing some functions for rickrolling in R.
